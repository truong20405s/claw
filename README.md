# Auto Login MiMo

This project runs as a background worker. It does not expose an HTTP port.

## Railway deployment

Railpack reads `railpack.json`, installs Chromium, and starts the nodriver worker
with `python app.py --headless`. Linux servers without a display automatically
enable headless mode as well.

Deploy `accounts.json` together with the source. Its structure is:

```json
{"interval_hours":4,"accounts":[{"account":"first@example.com","password":"secret"}]}
```

The prompt is loaded from this Google Drive file by default:

```text
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SXbCW-6bFvVvsq70xtb_rk3thTscc2cP/view?usp=drive_link
```

To use another prompt file, pass a local path or URL:

```powershell
python app.py --prompt-source .\custom-prompt.txt
```

## Local run

Install `requirements.txt` and run:

```powershell
python app.py
```

A failed account switches immediately to the next account; the configured
rotation interval is applied only after a completed account session. If every
account in a cycle fails, the worker waits five minutes before retrying so a
website outage cannot create a tight retry loop.
